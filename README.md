# Introduction
• As a computer science BTech student I went across the net to learn more about sh, but could'nt find a proper code for this program, so I made my own from scratch and as simple and minimal as possible, hope this helps you guys a lot for your education and practical lab purposes<br>
• The speciality of this code, unlike other codes, you add the elements into the array after runtime. <br>
• To facilitate better readability of code, I've added necessary comments in the code to simulate the flow of control in the code
